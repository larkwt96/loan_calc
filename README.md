# Loan Calculator

This application is a loan calculator I built, partly because I needed one,
and partly because I'm trying to learn react, bootstrap and javascript.

# Things I've Learned or Practiced with this Project

## React/Bootstrap
- React doesn't need bootstrap
- There's bootstrap.css, bootstrap.js, and even React which re-implements
bootstrap.
- Just use arrow functions, no need to bind
- assign state in body, no need for constructor

## Development Practices
- Test driven development helps design and break things into components
- Build as you go. Don't build the entire thing because it's hard to adapt.
- Don't worry about clean or fast code initially. Once tests pass, then
refactor it to clean code and built out modules.

## Javascript
- I now see why lodash is helpful.
- ES is the main. javascript implements it. Babel and typescript are super
javascripts which get transpiled.
